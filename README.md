In order to reproduce the results of my project, you should first download
the dataset called adult.data from either my Gradescope submission or from UCI
Machine Learning Repository’s website [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).
If you are downloading from the link, you should click on Data Folder then
click on adult.data to download the dataset. Then, you should save it in the
same folder that you are storing all of my project files. Afterwards, open
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and ensure that your development environment is
set-up accordingly to the class’ instructions [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse163/21wi/software.html).
Once VS Code has been properly set-up, open the folder that my project
files are stored in. Then, using the terminal in VS Code install plotly
using $ conda install -c plotly plotly=4.14.3 or follow the instructions under
"Installation" from plotly's site [here](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/).
When the above have been done, my files run_income_project.py (main Python module to run)
and income_project_test.py (Python module to test) should be able to run and produce print statements in the terminal and graphs should be created in the folder that my project is
stored in. For my testing file, you will need to download my custom testing file called
adult.test that I submitted through Gradescope. After all that has been done, everything
should be properly running now.
