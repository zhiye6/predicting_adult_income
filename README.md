The background of this Adult Dataset is that it provides data on the income of adult
individuals. This data includes relevant information that are potential factors that determines
the income of adults such as age, education, gender, race, etc. The motivation behind this
project is to use machine learning to accurately predict whether the income of an adult will
exceed $50,000 per year based on the census data. By doing so, I can discover if there are any
underlying factors that determines whether or not an adult individual will make over $50,000
per year. Additionally, I will push my analysis further by computing income across genders at
every race and occupation to discover if there is an income inequality gap present in the
dataset. Furthermore, I will analyze how a factor such as education affects the income of adults
to see if there is a large disparity of income levels for adult individuals with varying education.
Overall, the goal of this project is to determine the underlying factors that affect income for
adult individuals. My analysis will be able provide answers to societal questions such as “how
does education affect the income of an adult individual?” and “is there an income inequality
gap between males and females across race and occupation?” If you interested in viewing more,
